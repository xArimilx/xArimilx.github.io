    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>My name is Geoffrey Carder. I was born in Japan and raised in Missouri. I finished my primary education in Missouri, and attended secondary school in California. I spent roughly three years at California State Polytechnic University of Pomona before joining the United States military. My service to the country lasted about five years. I left the service to join Raytheon Technologies. I worked as a Land Based Phalanx Weapons System Field Engineer. This was actually part of my job in the military. I worked with Raytheon for about a year only to work some odd jobs. After a few months of the odd work, I decided to attempt college. I spent two semesters at OU Norman only to transfer out of my degree and school to OCCC and into Computer Science. So far, I am thouroughly enjoying my course work. All I need now, is another three full semesters and I should have an associates degree.</p>
