    <h3>Heartache</h3>
	<h4>11/06/2022</h4>
      <p>It all began four years ago. I had been transitioning out of the military and noticed
      this beautiful girl working at the grocery store. I always tried to say hi to her but, she
      was always to absorbed with the task at hand. She was never mean, and did her job well.</p>
      <p>A couple months pass and I finally was out of the military and living with a friend.
      Conviently, my friend lived BEHIND this girl's work. Sadly, I did not have the courage
      to talk to her. A few weeks pass by. My buddy's birthday is "going" (not enough people showed up)
      on. I was wearing an Umbreon onsie to lighten the mood. Somehow the party ran out of cups. So I set
      off on the journey to this girls work. I look to the friend by my side and say, "Well I AM getting her
      number tonight. THIS is the night.". So here we both are, piss drunk, riding hoverboards, cruising around
      her store. This girl was here! I had made a small error though... there were too many customers in the
      check out lane. So clumsily, I look at her and say, "Oh, don't worry I can let these kind customers go first.".
      It was a tad awkward but the customers were thankful. I slowly roll up to her register, pay for my product,
      and start legitimate small talk with her. We talked for several minutes and I got her number! Who new
      that an awkward guy like myself wearing a onesie could do this!</p>
      <p>Well, fast forward a couple months and we are dating! These were the most wonderful months I had ever had. Unfortunately, my Raytheon application
      finally came back. I had to move OUT OF STATE. Luckily for me, she agreed to attempt a long distance
      relationship. We managed to see each other every month, video chat every day, and well keep the love going.
      It took only three months for me to relocate back to her state. My company sent me on one year travel to her town.
      That whole year, we lived out a hotel, ate whatever we wanted, and went where ever we could. So many memorable
      days and nights. This was actually the beginning of the end. After that year, I had lost my job and moved into
      Oklahoma City. I had managed to buy the PERFECT house for my girlfriend, and I, and her family. At first, everything
      seemed to be going the right direction. Happy days, mild disagreements between the family members, etc. It took  
      only four months for her family to move out to their own place.</p>
      <p>The problems began! Arguments, hurtful words, etc. Somehow we still managed to love each other immensley.
      It took almost a year for this relationship to implode. All it took was one slightly biffed meal, and an argument,
      for things to end. I couldn't deal with the arguments anymore. Within hours we had broken up in of the most horrid ways.
      For months, my heart yearned for her. To reverse my decision. But, I couldn't bear the opportunity of another fight. To my surprise,
      she actually came back to me! We started going on dates, rebuilding the love! But alas, this was all a delusional dream...
      I thought we had both grown but, we havent. Things ended so fast and cold. So here I am again, mending what I can.</p>
