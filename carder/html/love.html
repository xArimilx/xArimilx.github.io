  <h3>Love</h3>
  <h4>11/06/2022</h4>
    <p>What is love? I have always asked myself this. We know what familial love is.
    But, what is romantic and self love? For some of us, we learn these from a
    young age. For others, it takes much longer. As for this "romantic" love,
    it is not what Hollywood and Disney has sold us. Yes, if were lucky we can
    feel the pure rush and electricity of being with someone buuut, this is 
    normally part of the honeymoon phase. After roughly three years, the hormones
    produced by the honeymoon phase fade away. Now what is romantic love without this?
    Well it is the ability to stand by each other no matter what, to dedicate your life
    to theirs, to support and grow with each other (even through the tough times). Love
    is not something to throw away after the honeymoon phase, look deep within your own
    heart and reach out with it to hold onto your person.</p>
    <p>Now the most important of the "love" is self love. You must have the ability to geniunly     
    like who you are. You are happy or even proud of your physical self. You are happy
    with YOUR dress style, YOUR hobbies, and YOUR interests. So do not self depricate!
    Be happy, and live YOUR life!</p>
